## 📏 Rules, Practices and Principles

1. Each folder begins with `WD-` to represent Web Dev structure.
2. Every section/page contains its own `index.html`.
3. Page folders maintain their own `assets` for CSS/images.
4. Use **camelCase** for file names.
   - Example: `projectCardImage.jpg`
5. Follow semantic HTML5 practices for better accessibility and SEO.
6. Use external CSS only—avoid inline styles.
7. Stick to a clean, serif design system for brand consistency.
